# Rusty zombie
A full-nonsense (yes, it's a nonsense) [Zombie](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/zombie.html) language interpreter written in rust.

## Why?
I don't know. 

## How?
Read the specs of the language [here](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/zombie.html).

## Running
This interpreter runs on a single command:
```cli
cargo run [filename]
```
Where `[filename]` is a valid .zombie file.
